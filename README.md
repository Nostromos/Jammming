<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. A lot of this stuff seems pretty basic to any experienced devs but this is a big reach for me and will take some time. If I make it to initial release, that'll be a victory. I may come up with ideas for future features & enhancements down the line and while I'll track those in issues, I may not continue to develop this further.

The main goals of this project are:

- Building a web app using React
- Version controlling the application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Integrating with Spotify (maybe others too)
- Deploying the application somewhere cost-effective
- Writing good documentation ncluding:
    - The purpose of the project
    - Technologies used
    - How to get it set up yourself
    - Features
    - Future work

The basic feature list should include:
- Users can search for songs by song title.
- You can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
- Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
- You can also include other information – the design is up to you
- Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account

Prerequisites:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- HTTP Requests and Responses
- Authentication
